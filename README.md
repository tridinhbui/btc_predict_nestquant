NESTQUANTT Market Test Auto Hourly Crawling and Training
This project focuses on automating the process of hourly crawling, preprocessing, training, and submitting for the NESTQUANTT Market Test. The goal is to streamline the data collection, preprocessing, and model training workflow for more efficient market analysis.

Features
Automated Crawling: The script automatically performs hourly crawling of market data to ensure the most up-to-date information is collected.

Data Preprocessing: The collected data undergoes preprocessing to clean, transform, and organize it into a suitable format for model training.

Model Training: The preprocessed data is used to train predictive models that can provide insights into market trends and behaviors.

Submission Generation: The trained models can generate submissions that provide valuable information about market conditions.
